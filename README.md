# 👋 Hey, I'm Taylor Wyatt

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a hands-on builder and problem solver who’s shifting gears from **construction and carpentry** into the world of **data science**. I’m currently training at **TripleTen’s Data Science bootcamp**, building skills in Python, SQL, machine learning, and data visualization.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On
- 📊 Predicting customer churn for a telecom provider using machine learning
- 🛒 Analyzing shopping behavior in Instacart data with Python and pandas
- 🧠 Exploring time series forecasting for taxi demand

## 🔧 Skills I'm Building
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- SQL (joins, window functions, subqueries)
- Machine Learning (regression, classification, boosting)
- Data cleaning, visualization, and analysis
- Git, Jupyter, Streamlit dashboards

## 🧭 My Career Pivot
After years of building homes and managing crews, I’m bringing that same grit and detail-focus to tech. I love solving messy problems, digging into data, and making information work for people. My long-term goal is to work **remotely** in **data science** — or freelance for mission-driven teams that value curiosity, hustle, and clarity.

## 🛠️ Current Projects

- 🧠 [Interconnect Churn Prediction](./Churn%20Prediction%20Project)  
  Built a classification model to predict customer churn using contract, internet, and personal data. Focused on AUC-ROC ≥ 0.88 using LightGBM, preprocessing pipelines, and customer segmentation insights.

- 🛍️ [Instacart Market Basket EDA](./Instacart%20EDA%20Project)  
  Performed exploratory data analysis on millions of grocery orders. Identified top-selling products, reorder trends, and user shopping patterns. Created visualizations and performed product-level behavior analysis.

- 🚕 [Taxi Demand Forecasting](./Time%20Series%20Taxi%20Project)  
  Used time series modeling (SARIMA, CatBoost, LightGBM) to forecast hourly taxi ride demand. Evaluated models on RMSE ≤ 48. Included feature engineering (lags, rolling means) and test set evaluation.

- 🧮 [Linear Algebra for Image Compression](./Linear%20Alg%20Project)  
  Applied Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for compressing grayscale images. Explored matrix rank, reconstruction error, and visual impact of compression in real-world images.

- 🚗 [Rusty Car Value Prediction](./Rusty%20Car%20sales%20Project)  
  Built regression models (Linear, Random Forest, LightGBM) to estimate used car prices. Focused on data cleaning, feature encoding, and validation RMSE comparison. Implemented grouped imputation and category merging.

- 💼 [ML for Business Decisions](./ML%20in%20Business%20Project)  
  Predicted ad campaign ROI using logistic regression and decision trees. Evaluated strategies based on profit estimates. Applied business logic to guide investment choices using model outcomes.

- 🧑‍💻 [Supervised Learning Pipeline](./Supervised%20Learning%20Project)  
  Designed and trained multiple supervised learning models (LogReg, Random Forest, XGBoost) on classification tasks. Emphasized pipeline creation, hyperparameter tuning, and overfitting analysis.

- 🔍 [SQL Analytics for Bookstore](./SQL%20Project)  
  Wrote advanced SQL queries to analyze a bookstore database. Used joins, filtering, aggregation, and window functions to extract business insights and support strategic planning.
