# 👋 Hey, I'm Taylor Wyatt

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a hands-on builder and problem solver who’s shifting gears from **construction and carpentry** into the world of **data science**. I’m currently training at **TripleTen’s Data Science bootcamp**, building skills in Python, SQL, machine learning, and data visualization.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On
- 📊 Predicting customer churn for a telecom provider using machine learning
- 🛒 Analyzing shopping behavior in Instacart data with Python and pandas
- 🧠 Exploring time series forecasting for taxi demand

## 🔧 Skills I'm Building
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- SQL (joins, window functions, subqueries)
- Machine Learning (regression, classification, boosting)
- Data cleaning, visualization, and analysis
- Git, Jupyter, Streamlit dashboards

## 🧭 My Career Pivot
After years of building homes and managing crews, I’m bringing that same grit and detail-focus to tech. I love solving messy problems, digging into data, and making information work for people. My long-term goal is to work **remotely** in **data science** — or freelance for mission-driven teams that value curiosity, hustle, and clarity.

## 🛠️ My Data Science Projects

These are hosted in my [Data_projects_TripleTen](https://github.com/TwyattDS/Data_projects_TripleTen) repository:

- 🧠 [Interconnect Churn Prediction](https://github.com/TwyattDS/Data_projects_TripleTen/blob/main/Churn_Prediction_Project/Churn_Prediction_Project.ipynb)  
  Built a classification model to predict customer churn using contract, internet, and personal data. Focused on AUC-ROC ≥ 0.88 using LightGBM, preprocessing pipelines, and customer segmentation insights.

- 🛍️ [Instacart Market Basket EDA](https://github.com/TwyattDS/Data_projects_TripleTen/blob/main/Instacart_EDA_Project/Instacart_EDA_Project.ipynb)  
  Performed exploratory data analysis on millions of grocery orders. Identified top-selling products, reorder trends, and user shopping patterns. Created visualizations and performed product-level behavior analysis.

- 🚕 [Taxi Demand Forecasting](https://github.com/TwyattDS/Data_projects_TripleTen/blob/main/Time_Series_Taxi_Project/Time_Series_Taxi_Project.ipynb)  
  Used time series modeling (SARIMA, CatBoost, Light
